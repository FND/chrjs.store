A  generic store object, using the chrjs library.

Includes mechanisms to interact with tiddlers, bags, recipes, etc on TiddlySpace
and mechanisms to refresh those things and keep them up to date in the
browser.

The intention is that eventually, it will grow to encompass TiddlyWeb and not
just TiddlySpace, though its main aim is to provide a useful object for syncing
and managing tiddlers between the browser and server. The hope is that this will
lead to more and easier/quicker to write lightweight SPAs, for when something
like a full blown TiddlyWiki is too heavy duty.

Please feel free to fork and send in pull requests/tests, etc as currently, it's
very incomplete (no support for DELETE, etc).

Dependencies: chrjs, jQuery, TiddlySpace.
